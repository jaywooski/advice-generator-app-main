## Acknowledgments

Would love to give a big shout out to all developers who help just by expressing their expertise and knowledge on ways to code better. Clean code is always the way to go. You do not only get better at coding by just coding. Usually, you're learning from someone else. Thankful for everyone who responds on StackOverflow, posts on YouTube, and others who express easy to follow methods on their blog sites.
